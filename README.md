# Emotion Delivery Game Overview
## Concept

Emotion Delivery is a side-scrolling platforming game where player navigates through obstacles to deliver a package to its destination. Set in a typical game world with the twist that certain actions lead to unlocking hidden achievements that can lead to positive or negative emotions. The achievements are hidden until the package is delivered. The audience/player is revealed to be the recipient of the package and the player's achievements are unpackaged and an overall emotion influences the mood of the win screen.

The game is not meant to be replayable because once the secret is revealed the player knows to behave better next time. Meant to measure the ethical choices of the player.

## Core Mechanics

Package interaction: Pick up, put down, throw package. Package can also interact with world objects, like breaking pottery or knocking over NPCs.

Player action telemetry: Use high instances of an action to indicate frustration from the player. For example, teabagging, package abuse, etc.

Achievement system: Hidden achievements are tied to positive or negative emotion and tallied up at the end of the game.

Puzzles and platforming: Present some challenging obstacles for the player to overcome.

Global player stats: See how you rated against other players.

## Art Style

Mix of modern and classic 2D platformer art style. Obstacles should be more real world in nature. Player will be ambiguous delivery person.
